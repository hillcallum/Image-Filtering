# Image-Filtering

This repository contains the first coursework project from the Computer Vision module of the MSc Computing programme at Imperial College London. It explores fundamental image filtering methods, such as moving average, Sobel, Gaussian, and separable filters, and implements efficient convolution techniques, including a 2D convolution using PyTorch.
